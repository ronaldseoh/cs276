# Chapter 6: Scoring, term weighting, and the vector space model

- Rank-order the documents
- Three ideas:
    1. Parametric and zone indexes
        - To index and retrieve documents
        - Simple means of scoring
    2. Weighting importance of a term in a document, using statistics of occurrence
    3. Viewing each document as a vector of weights
        - Vector space scoring: to compute a score between *a query* and *each document*
