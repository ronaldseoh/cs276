# Chapter 15: Support vector machines and machine learning on documents

- Generation of state-of-the-art classifiers: SVM, boosted decision trees, regularized logistic regression, neural networks, random forests
- SVM on linearly separable and non-separable datasets
- What sort of classifiers are appropriate when, and how can you exploit domain-specific text features in classification?
- Machine learning on how to rank documents in ad hoc retrieval
