# Boolean Retrieval

## What's IR?

- Information Retrieval: Finding materials of an *unstructured* nature
- Unstructured data: Data which does not have clear, semantically overt, easy-for-a-computer structure
- Almost no data are truly 'unstructured': IR can also be used to facilitate "semi-structured" search
- Filtering / Clustering documents
- Web search, personal information retrieval, and enterprise, institutional, and domain-specific search
