# Lecture 19: Web Question Answering

## Background: New trends in web search

- Despite the name *information retrieval*, it's not really *information* retrieval. It's more of *document* retrieval.
- New common theme in search engines: doing graph search over structured knowledge rather than traditional text search.
    - More semi-structured information embedded in web pages
- Move to mobile favors a move to speech, which favors *natural language information search* - proving impoortance of NLU and **QA**.
- Toward more intelligent agents: two goals
    1. Things not strings
    2. Inference not search
