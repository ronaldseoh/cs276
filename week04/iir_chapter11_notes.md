# Chapter 11: Probabilistic Information Retrieval

- Estimating the probability of a term `t` appearing in a relevant document `P(t | R = 1)`
- Users' *information needs* -> translated into *query representations*
- Documents -> *Document representation*
- In the Boolean or vector space models, matching is done in a formally defined but *semantically imprecise calculus* of index terms: *Uncertain guesses*
- Probability provides a principled foundation for reasoning under uncertainty

## 11.1 Review of basic probability theory

- A little basic probability theory
